    <h1>Hamza's Argument</h1>

    <p>   While Ayman agrees that KFC is a great place to get fried chicken, I disagree, infact I find Popeyes to be the more<br> superior place in terms of fast-food chicken because of the better restaurant aesthetics, overall quality of food, and<br> the fact that it is certified Halal in Southern-Ontario.</p>

    <p>To start off, the better restaurant aesthetics. For example, whenever I walk into a KFC the vibes I get from the<br> place is just decent, there is nothing wrong about it, but there isn't anything right aswell, it's a very generic<br> looking place on the inside with almost red and white everything, it feels pretty boring for the most part.<br> However, it's a much different story for Popeyes, they have very vibrant and eye-pleasing decor located around<br> the building, which gives me much more enjoyable vibes from the store.</p>

    <p>Second of all, the quality of food. For example, the quality of the food is the most important factor of a restaurant,<br> and it's why Popeye's is superior in that way, unlike KFC, Popeye's has tender, flavourful and juicy chicken with a<br> crisp breading on the chicken. For KFC, it's just boring old chicken, they may have 12 herbs and spices in their<br> blend, but it dosen't change the fact that it's just plain-old chicken.</p>

    <p>Last of all, Halal Certification. To those who don't know, Halal is an Arabic word for 'permissable' in English,<br> meaning that the meat, which is usually beef, chicken or goat/lamb, has to be hand-slaughtered in a specific way to<br> make it 'permissable' for Muslim people to eat, the idea of Halal food is also similar to Kosher foods. For 25 years,<br> all 59 of the Popeye's restaurants in Southern-Ontario have been certified Halal according to court documents,<br> meaning Popeye's would be able to bring in more Muslim customers over KFC.</p>

    <p>To summarize, I think that Popeye's is better than KFC because it offers a nicer aesthetic and feel to the restaurant,<br> it provides higher-quality and better-tasting food to its customers, and it has a Halal certification which helps bring<br> in more Muslim customers.</p>
