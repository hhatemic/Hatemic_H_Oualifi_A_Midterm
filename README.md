# Midterm: Debate Club Assignment
 Ayman agrees that KFC is a good fast food place to get chicken, but 
 Hamza disagrees, and prefers Popeyes. In this assignment, we are 
 creating a one-page html folder, divided into 2 sections, where the 
 both of us will either make an argument FOR, or AGAINST the topic, 
 and give some reasons to defend their statement, two images will be 
 added, one from each person, that is related to the topic of the 
 argument.
